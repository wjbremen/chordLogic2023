******************
****5 chords will be a special case: can span up to 6 strings or as
little as 2 (we do not have 2 string voicings now)
-"subchords category"- so in the future can add other intervals

-altered chords usually done 
on dominant chords, and the four alterations that 
are commonly used are the ♭5, ♯5, ♭9 and ♯9. 

plan: 
1) 5 chords on each scale degree- special case
-need chords spanning as many as 6 strings and 
as few as 2 strings
-only need root and 1st inversion 
2)so 5 chords should be a part of another
object called "subchords" with scale degrees 
-make it so other subchords or intervals can be 
added later 
3)altered/special chords should be a new object
-altered chords that are typically used on a 
scale degree
-altered and special chords not associated with a 
scale degree
